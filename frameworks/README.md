This shall capture all my understanding of frameworks.

Framework thinking is important. It might be the only thing that can bring any order to an otherwise chaotic world, at work or otherwise.

It's simple — you define the operating principles of your ideal universe as best as you can, call it your framework, and then, only do things that comply with this framework.

If you're ever compelled to do something that falls outside of it, then you first modify the operating principles of your framework to make room for the thing, and only then proceed with doing whatever it is that you wanted to do. This way, your framework is always synchronized — so no matter how arbitrary your decisions seem on the outside, internally, you know they are deriving their meaning from something far more organised and meaningful — your framework. 

If this is a style you want to adopt, make sure that you are always operating within a framework you have thoughtfully, even painstakingly designed and kept updated over time. It's hard, hard, hard work, but if done well, it affords immense freedom to not have to worry about the purpose of your actions every single day, and thus experiment without losing focus.

Some also call it Strategy.
