Zombie process is the one that has completed all its execution and all the system resources
associated with it have been released. But the processâ€™s entry is still there in the process table.
This entry may be required by the parent process to read the exit status of the process.
To create a zombie process, the parent process shall not call the wait system call.
If the parent process has registered for signal SIG_IGN that is ignore signal, then the zombie
process will not be created and the child process will die after it completes execution.
