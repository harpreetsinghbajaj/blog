Orphan Process is the one whose parent had exited keeping the child process running. After the parent exits, the child process is adopted by the Unixâ€™s init process.
This process has all its resources, memory space, etc available for its operation to continue. 
A process can be intentionally or unintentionally orphan. For intentional creation of orphan 
process, refer daemon process. Unintentional creation is possible if the parent process crashes.
