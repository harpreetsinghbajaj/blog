mutual exclusion can be implemented by many ways. One way is when the lock is acquired all the interrrupts can be disabled so that there is nothing that can disturb the processor. Other way is busy waiting in which the thread will keep rolling in a while loop and keep wasting the cpu cycles in checking if the variable has been set to true. Now the other way is to put the thread to sleep using the system call.
