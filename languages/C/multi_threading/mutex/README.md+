Mutex is implemented as a integer that has 0 and 1 value. 0 means it is locked and the other thread will now have to wait because it cannot acquire the already acquired mutex. Now the other thread has to wait. The thread can wait In the user space by busy waiting and keeping the cpu occupied.  The other thing can be that the thread has to sleep. Sleep is a system call that will make the OS to move the thread to waiting queue. Now when the unlock is called then the wake system call is called and the os takes the responsibility of waking up the thread and scheduling it.
