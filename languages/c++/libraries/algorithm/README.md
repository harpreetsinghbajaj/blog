algorithm library is also very powerful and it has many functions that can help in cracking the questions easily. Few of the most useful are:


for_each. This accept starting and ending iterator and a functor which works on every element of the container.


is_permutation. This checks if one range is a permutation of another.


all_of returns true if a condition returns true for all the the elements in the container.


find_if returns an element to the first element in the container if the condition matches.
