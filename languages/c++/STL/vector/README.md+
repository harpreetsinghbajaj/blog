C++ vector = operator
This operator in c++11 I think calls the move ctor because I wrote one program but there I was not able to explain the outcome without move ctor.

This is not the correct understanding as the vector assignment  calls the assignment operator. Assignment operator is not destruction and construction. Instead itâ€™s like memcpy.

I created a vector of size 2 and assigned a vector of size 1 to it. At that time the second object in the vector got destroyed by a dtor call.  So my doubt is clear.

If you create a vector of size 0 and assign it to a vector of size n then copy ctor will be called n times and size of new vector will be n
