Session is a set of dialogues and media flowing among participants.

Session refresh is a sip mechanism to make sure that proxies can remove the call contexts if the refresh does not happens in a specified period of time. There is a session expires timer that is present in invite which has to expire if refresh is not received and clean the context. If refresh comes the timer restarts.
