In tcp 3 way handshake the resources are allocated on receiving the first syn message due to which the denial of service attack can be done in tcp by sending the syn message from bogus senders and blocking the resources in server.

In tcp only one address is supported by the host. If u want multiple tcp addresse then application level program has to be coded.

In tcp there is only one stream so out of order delivery is not possible and hence delay is added.

In tcp, the party that sends the FIN means that it will not send data anymore but it remains active to receive the data. That is why the time wait sockets are seen. Time wait means that the local endpoint has closed the connection and closed wait is that the remote endpoint has closed the connection
