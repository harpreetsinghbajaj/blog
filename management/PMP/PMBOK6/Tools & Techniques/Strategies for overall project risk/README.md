Strategies for overall 
 project risk

Risk responses should be planned and implemented not only for individual project risks but also to address overall 
project risk. The same risk response strategies that are used to deal with individual project risks can also be applied to 
overall project risk:

Avoid. Where the level of overall project risk is significantly negative and outside the agreed-upon risk 
thresholds for the project, an avoid strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to reduce 
the negative effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole and bring the project back within the thresholds. 

Exploit. Where the level of overall project risk is significantly positive and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds 
for the project, an exploit strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to capture the positive 
effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole

Transfer/share. If the level of overall project risk is high but the organization is unable to address it effectively, 
a third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of the organization. Where overall project risk is 
negative, a transfer strategy is required, which may involve payment of a risk premium.

Mitigate/enhance. These strategies involve changing the level of overall project risk to optimize the chances 
of achieving the projectâ€™s objectives. The mitigation strategy is used where overall project risk is negative, and 
enhancement applies when it is positive

Accept. Where no proactive risk response strategy is possible to address overall project risk, the organization 
may choose to continue with the project as currently defined, even if overall project risk is outside the agreedupon thresholds.
