Historical information review

Historical Information. Documents and data on prior projects including project files, records, correspondence, closed 
contracts, and closed projects

Reviewing historical information can assist in developing parametric estimates or analogous estimates. Historical 
information may include project characteristics (parameters) to develop mathematical models to predict total project 
costs. Such models may be simple (e.g., residential home construction is based on a certain cost per square foot of space) 
or complex (e.g., one model of software development costing uses multiple separate adjustment factors, each of which 
has numerous points within it).
