Strategies for opportunities

Five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with opportunities, as follows:
uu Escalate. This risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that 
an opportunity is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project 
managerâ€™s authority.

Exploit. The exploit strategy may be selected for high-priority opportunities where the organization wants to 
ensure that the opportunity is realized

Share. Sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that it shares some of the 
benefit if the opportunity occurs

Enhance. The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or impact of an opportunity

Accept. Accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is taken. This strategy may 
be appropriate for low-priority opportunities, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective 
to address an opportunity in any other way
