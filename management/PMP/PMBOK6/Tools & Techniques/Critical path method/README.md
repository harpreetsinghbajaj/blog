Critical path method

The critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of schedule 
flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model.
This schedule network analysis technique calculates 
the early start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitations 
by performing a forward and backward pass analysis through the schedule network

The longest path has the least total floatâ€”usually zero

Early Finish Date (EF). In the critical path method, the earliest possible point in time when the uncompleted portions of 
a schedule activity can finish based on the schedule network logic, the data date, and any schedule constraints.
Early Start Date (ES). In the critical path method, the earliest possible point in time when the uncompleted portions of 
a schedule activity can start based on the schedule network logic, the data date, and any schedule constraints.

Forward Pass. A critical path method technique for calculating the early start and early finish dates by working forward 
through the schedule model from the project start date or a given point in time.


Late Finish Date (LF). In the critical path method, the latest possible point in time when the uncompleted portions of a 
schedule activity can finish based on the schedule network logic, the project completion date, and any schedule constraints.
Late Start Date (LS). In the critical path method, the latest possible point in time when the uncompleted portions of a 
schedule activity can start based on the schedule network logic, the project completion date, and any schedule constraints
