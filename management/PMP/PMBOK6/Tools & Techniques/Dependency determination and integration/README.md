Dependency determination and integration


Dependencies may be characterized by the following attributes: mandatory or discretionary, internal or external 
(as described below). Dependency has four attributes, but two can be applicable at the same time in the following 
ways: mandatory external dependencies, mandatory internal dependencies, discretionary external dependencies, or 
discretionary internal dependencies

Mandatory dependencies. Mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or contractually required or 
inherent in the nature of the work.

Discretionary dependencies. Discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic, 
preferential logic, or soft logic. Discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of best 
practices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a specific sequence 
is desired, even though there may be other acceptable sequences.


External dependencies. External dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and nonproject activities. These dependencies are usually outside of the project team’s control


Internal dependencies. Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities and 
are generally inside the project team’s control
