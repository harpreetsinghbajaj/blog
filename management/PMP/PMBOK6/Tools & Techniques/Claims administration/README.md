Claims administration

Contested changes and potential constructive changes are those requested changes where the buyer and seller 
cannot reach an agreement on compensation for the change or cannot agree that a change has occurred. These 
contested changes are called claims.

When they cannot be resolved, they become disputes and finally appeals
 If the parties themselves do not resolve a claim, it may have to be handled in accordance with 
alternative dispute resolution (ADR) typically following procedures established in the contract. Settlement of all claims 
and disputes through negotiation is the preferred method.
