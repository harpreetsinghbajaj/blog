Strategies for threats


Five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with threats, as follows:
uu Escalate. Escalation is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that a threat is outside 
the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project managerâ€™s authority.

Avoid. Risk avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its 
impact. It may be appropriate for high-priority threats with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative 
impact

Transfer. Transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the 
impact if the threat occurs.

Mitigate. In risk mitigation, action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or impact of a threat. Early 
mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred

Accept. Risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat, but no proactive action is taken. This strategy 
may be appropriate for low-priority threats, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective 
to address a threat in any other way
