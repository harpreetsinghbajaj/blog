Quality improvement methods


Quality improvements can occur based on findings and recommendations from quality control processes, the findings 
of the quality audits, or problem solving in the Manage Quality process. Plan-do-check-act and Six Sigma are two of the 
most common quality improvement tools used to analyze and evaluate opportunities for improvement.
