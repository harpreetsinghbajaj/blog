Change control tools

In order to facilitate configuration and change management, manual or automated tools may be used.

Configuration control is focused on the specification of both the deliverables and the processes
Tools should support the following configuration management activities:
uu Identify configuration item. Identification and selection of a configuration item to provide the basis for which 
the product configuration is defined and verified, products and documents are labeled, changes are managed, 
and accountability is maintained.
uu Record and report configuration item status. Information recording and reporting about each configuration item.
uu Perform configuration item verification and audit. Configuration verification and configuration audits ensure 
that the composition of a projectâ€™s configuration items is correct and that corresponding changes are registered, 
assessed, approved, tracked, and correctly implemented. This ensures that the functional requirements defined 
in the configuration documentation are met


change control is focused on identifying, documenting, and approving or rejecting changes to the project documents, deliverables, or baselines.

Tools should support the following change management activities as well:
uu Identify changes. Identifying and selecting a change item for processes or project documents.
uu Document changes. Documenting the change into a proper change request.
uu Decide on changes. Reviewing the changes; approving, rejecting, deferring, or making any other decision about 
changes to the project documents, deliverables, or baselines.
uu Track changes. Verifying that the changes are registered, assessed, approved, and tracked and communicating 
final results to stakeholders
