Schedule network analysis
 A technique to identify early and late start dates, as well as early and late finish dates, for 
the uncompleted portions of project activities.
overarching technique used to generate the project schedule model. It employs 
several other techniques such as critical path method, resource optimization techniques, and modeling techniques


Additional analysis includes but 
is not limited to:
uu Assessing the need to aggregate schedule reserves to reduce the probability of a schedule slip when multiple 
paths converge at a single point in time or when multiple paths diverge from a single point in time, to reduce the 
probability of a schedule slip.
uu Reviewing the network to see if the critical path has high-risk activities or long lead items that would necessitate 
use of schedule reserves or the implementation of risk responses to reduce the risk on the critical path.
Schedule network analysis is an iterative process that is employed until a viable schedule model is developed
