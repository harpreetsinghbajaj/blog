Communication technology Specific tools, systems, computer programs, etc., used to transfer information among 
project stakeholders


Examples of communication technology that may 
be used are:
uu Shared portal. A shared repository for information sharing (e.g., website, collaboration software or intranet) is 
effective for virtual project teams.
uu Video conferencing. Video conferencing is an important technique for effective communication with 
virtual teams.
uu Audio conferencing. Communication within a team using audio conferencing is another technique to build 
rapport and confidence within virtual teams.
uu Email/chat. Regular communications using email and chat is also an effective technique.


Factors that can affect the choice of communication technology include:
uu Urgency of the need for information. The urgency, frequency, and format of the information to be communicated 
may vary from project to project and also within different phases of a project.
uu Availability and reliability of technology. The technology that is required for distribution of project 
communications artifacts should be compatible, available, and accessible for all stakeholders throughout 
the project.
uu Ease of use. The choice of communication technologies should be suitable for project participants and proper 
training events should be planned, where appropriate.
Project environment. Whether the team will meet and operate on a face-to-face basis or in a virtual environment; 
whether they will be located in one or multiple time zones; whether they will use multiple languages for 
communication; and finally, whether there are any other project environmental factors, such as various aspects 
of culture, which may constrain the efficiency of the communication.
uu Sensitivity and confidentiality of the information. Some aspects to consider are:
un Whether information to be communicated is sensitive or confidential. If so, additional security measures may 
be required.
un Social media policies for employees to ensure appropriate behavior, security, and the protection of 
proprietary information.
