Techniques to gather data

1. Brainstorming:- This technique is used to identify a list of ideas in a short period of time. 
2. Focus groups:- Focus groups bring together prequalified stakeholders and subject matter experts to learn about 
their expectations and attitudes about a proposed product, service, or result.

3. Interviews:- An interview is a formal or informal approach to elicit information from stakeholders by talking 
to them directly. It is typically performed by asking prepared and spontaneous questions and recording the 
responses.
