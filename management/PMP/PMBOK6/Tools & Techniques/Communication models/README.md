Communication models

A description, analogy, or schematic used to represent how the communication process will 
be performed for the project

Communication models can represent the communication process in its most basic linear form (sender and receiver), 
in a more interactive form that encompasses the additional element of feedback (sender, receiver, and feedback), or in 
a more complex model that incorporates the human elements of the sender(s) or receiver(s) and attempts to show the 
complexity of any communication that involves people.
