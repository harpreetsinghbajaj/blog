Develop Project Charter

For this process, meetings are held with key stakeholders to identify the project objectives, success criteria, key 
deliverables, high-level requirements, summary milestones, and other summary information.


Develop Project Management Plan

For this process, meetings are used to discuss the project approach, determine how work will be executed to 
accomplish the project objectives, and establish the way the project will be monitored and controlled.
The project kick-off meeting is usually associated with the end of planning and the start of executing. Its purpose is 
to communicate the objectives of the project, gain the commitment of the team for the project, and explain the roles and 
responsibilities of each stakeholder.


The kick-off may occur at different points in time depending on the characteristics 
of the project:
uu For small projects, there is usually only one team that performs the planning and the execution. In this case, the 
kick-off occurs shortly after initiation, in the Planning Process Group, because the team is involved in planning.
uu In large projects, a project management team normally does the majority of the planning, and the remainder of the 
project team is brought on when the initial planning is complete, at the start of the development/implementation. 
In this instance, the kick-off meeting takes place with processes in the Executing Process Group.
Multiphase projects will typically include a kick-off meeting at the beginning of each phase.

Direct and Manage Project Work

Meetings are used to discuss and address pertinent topics of the project when directing and managing project work. Types of meetings 
include but are not limited to: kick-off, technical, sprint or iteration planning, Scrum daily standups, steering group, 
problem solving, progress update, and retrospective meetings

Monitor and Control Project Work

Meetings may be face-to-face, virtual, formal, or informal. They may include project team members and other project 
stakeholders when appropriate. Types of meetings include but are not limited to user groups and review meetings



Perform Integrated Change Control

Change control meetings are held with a change control board (CCB) that is responsible for meeting and reviewing 
the change requests and approving, rejecting, or deferring change requests. Most changes will have some sort of impact 
on time, cost, resources, or risks.


Close Project or Phase
Meetings are used to confirm that the deliverables have been accepted, to validate that the exit criteria have been 
met, to formalize the completion of the contracts, to evaluate the satisfaction of the stakeholders, to gather lessons 
learned, to transfer knowledge and information from the project, and to celebrate success. Types of meetings include but are not limited to close-out reporting meetings, customer 
wrap-up meetings, lessons learned meetings, and celebration meetings.

Plan Quality Management


Control Quality
The following meetings may be used as part of the Control Quality process:

been properly implemented, tested, completed, and certified.
uu Retrospectives/lesson learned. A meeting held by a project team to discuss:
un Successful elements in the project/phase,
un What could be improved,
