Schedule compression

techniques are used to shorten or accelerate the schedule duration without reducing the 
project scope in order to meet schedule constraints, imposed dates, or other schedule objectives.

Crashing. A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources. 
Examples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying to expedite delivery 
to activities on the critical path. Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resources 
will shorten the activityâ€™s duration.

Fast tracking. A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequence 
are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical 
path.
