Precedence diagramming
 method


The precedence diagramming method (PDM) is a technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activities 
are represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in which 
the activities are to be performed.


Finish-to-start (FS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity 
has finished. For example, installing the operating system on a PC (successor) cannot start until the PC hardware 
is assembled (predecessor).
uu Finish-to-finish (FF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity 
has finished. For example, writing a document (predecessor) is required to finish before editing the document 
(successor) can finish.
uu Start-to-start (SS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity 
has started. For example, level concrete (successor) cannot begin until pour foundation (predecessor) begins.
uu Start-to-finish (SF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity 
has started. For example, a new accounts payable system (successor) has to start before the old accounts 
payable system can be shut down (predecessor)
