Design for X

Design for X (DfX) is a set of technical guidelines that may be applied during the design of a product for the optimization 
of a specific aspect of the design. DfX can control or even improve the productâ€™s final characteristics. The X in DfX can 
be different aspects of product development, such as reliability, deployment, assembly, manufacturing, cost, service, 
usability, safety, and quality. Using the DfX may result in cost reduction, quality improvement, better performance, and 
customer satisfaction.
