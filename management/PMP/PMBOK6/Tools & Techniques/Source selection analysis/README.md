Source selection analysis

Commonly used selection methods include the following:
uu Least cost. The least cost method may be appropriate for procurements of a standard or routine nature where 
well-established practices and standards exist and from which a specific and well-defined outcome is expected, 
which can be executed at different costs.
uu Qualifications only. The qualifications only selection method applies when the time and cost of a full selection 
process would not make sense because the value of the procurement is relatively small. The buyer establishes 
a short list and selects the bidder with the best credibility, qualifications, experience, expertise, areas of 
specialization, and references

Quality-based/highest technical proposal score. The selected firm is asked to submit a proposal with both 
technical and cost details and is then invited to negotiate the contract if the technical proposal proves acceptable

Quality and cost-based. The quality and cost-based method allows cost to be included as a factor in the seller 
selection process

Sole source. The buyer asks a specific seller to prepare technical and financial proposals, which are then 
negotiated

Fixed budget. The fixed-budget method requires disclosing the available budget to invited sellers in the RFP 
and selecting the highest-ranking technical proposal within the budget
