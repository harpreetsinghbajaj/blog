Three-point estimating

A technique used to estimate cost or duration by applying an average or weighted average of 
optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimates when there is uncertainty with the individual activity estimates


The accuracy of single-point duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk. 
Using three-point estimates helps define an approximate range for an activity’s duration:
uu Most likely (tM). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources likely to be assigned, 
their productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, dependencies on other participants, and 
interruptions.
uu Optimistic (tO). The activity duration based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the activity.
uu Pessimistic (tP). The duration based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity


Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected duration, tE, 
can be calculated. One commonly used formula is triangular distribution:
tE = (tO + tM + tP) / 3.
Triangular distribution is used when there is insufficient historical data or when using judgmental data. Duration 
estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range of 
uncertainty around the expected duration.



The accuracy of single-point cost estimates may be improved by considering estimation 
uncertainty and risk and using three estimates to define an approximate range for an activity’s cost:
uu Most likely (cM). The cost of the activity, based on realistic effort assessment for the required work and any 
predicted expenses.
uu Optimistic (cO). The cost based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the activity.
uu Pessimistic (cP). The cost based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity

Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected cost, cE, can 
be calculated using a formula. Two commonly used formulas are triangular and beta distributions. The formulas are:
uu Triangular distribution. cE = (cO + cM + cP) / 3
uu Beta distribution. cE = (cO + 4cM + cP) / 6
