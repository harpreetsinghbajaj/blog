Analogous estimating

Analogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historical 
data from a similar activity or project. Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such as 
duration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a future 
project.

Analogous estimating is generally less costly and less time-consuming than other techniques, but it is also 
less accurate.

Analogous estimating is most reliable when the previous activities are similar in fact and not just in appearance, and the project team members preparing the estimates 
have the needed expertise.
