Data representation


Affinity diagrams. Affinity diagrams allow large numbers of ideas to be classified into groups for review and 
analysis.
uu Mind mapping. Mind mapping consolidates ideas created through individual brainstorming sessions into a 
single map to reflect commonality and differences in understanding and to generate new ideas

Flowcharts. Flowcharts are also referred to as process maps because they display the sequence of steps 
and the branching possibilities that exist for a process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more 
outputs.


Logical data model. Logical data models are a visual representation of an organization’s data, described in 
business language and independent of any specific technology. The logical data model can be used to identify 
where data integrity or other quality issues can arise.

Matrix diagrams. Matrix diagrams help find the strength of relationships among different factors, causes, and 
objectives that exist between the rows and columns that form the matrix


Cause-and-effect diagrams. Cause-and-effect diagrams are also known as fishbone diagrams, why-why 
diagrams, or Ishikawa diagrams. This type of diagram breaks down the causes of the problem statement identified 
into discrete branches, helping to identify the main or root cause of the problem

Histograms. Histograms show a graphical representation of numerical data

Scatter diagrams. A scatter diagram is a graph that shows the relationship between two variables. Scatter 
diagrams can demonstrate a relationship between any element of a process, environment, or activity on one axis 
and a quality defect on the other axis



Control charts. Control charts are used to determine whether or not a process is stable or has predictable 
performance. Upper and lower specification limits are based on the requirements and reflect the maximum and 
minimum values allowed. Upper and lower control limits are different from specification limits.


Hierarchical charts. The traditional organizational chart structure can be used to show positions and relationships 
in a graphical, top-down format. un Work breakdown structures (WBS). The WBS is designed to show how project deliverables are broken down 
into work packages and provide a way of showing high-level areas of responsibility. Organizational breakdown structure (OBS) is arranged according to an organization’s existing departments, units, or teams, with the project activities or 
work packages listed under each department. Resource breakdown structure. The resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical list of team and physical 
resources related by category and resource type that is used for planning, managing and controlling project 
work.


Assignment Matrix. A RACI chart is a useful tool to use to ensure clear assignment of roles and responsibilities when the team consists of internal and external resources. RACI (responsible, accountable, consult, and inform) chart

Text-oriented formats. Team member responsibilities that require detailed descriptions can be specified in textoriented formats. Usually in outline form, these documents provide information such as responsibilities, authority, 
competencies, and qualifications.



Probability and impact matrix. A probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the probability of each 
risk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs.


Hierarchical charts. Where risks have been categorized using more than two parameters, the probability and 
impact matrix cannot be used and other graphical representations are required. For example, a bubble chart displays 
three dimensions of data, where each risk is plotted as a disk (bubble), and the three parameters are represented 
by the x-axis value, the y-axis value, and the bubble size.

Power/interest grid, power/influence grid, or impact/influence grid. Each of these techniques supports 
a grouping of stakeholders according to their level of authority (power), level of concern about the project’s 
outcomes (interest), ability to influence the outcomes of the project (influence), or ability to cause changes to 
the project’s planning or execution.



Stakeholder engagement assessment matrix. A stakeholder engagement assessment matrix supports 
comparison between the current engagement levels of stakeholders and the desired engagement levels required 
for successful project delivery. One way to classify the engagement level of stakeholders is shown in Figure 13-6. 
The engagement level of stakeholders can be classified as follows:
un Unaware. Unaware of the project and potential impacts.
un Resistant. Aware of the project and potential impacts but resistant to any changes that may occur as a result 
of the work or outcomes of the project. These stakeholders will be unsupportive of the work or outcomes of 
the project.
un Neutral. Aware of the project, but neither supportive nor unsupportive.
un Supportive. Aware of the project and potential impacts and supportive of the work and its outcomes.
un Leading. Aware of the project and potential impacts and actively engaged in ensuring that the project 
is a success
