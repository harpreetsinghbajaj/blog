Representations of 
 uncertainty

Where the duration, cost, or resource requirement for a planned activity is uncertain, the range of possible values 
can be represented in the model as a probability distribution. This may take several forms. The most commonly used 
are triangular, normal, lognormal, beta, uniform, or discrete distributions.
