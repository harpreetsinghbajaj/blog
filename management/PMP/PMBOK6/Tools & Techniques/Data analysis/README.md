Data analysis


Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is used to select the corrective actions or a combination of corrective 
and preventive actions to implement when a deviation occurs.
uu Cost-benefit analysis. Described in Section 8.1.2.3. Cost-benefit analysis helps to determine the best corrective 
action in terms of cost in case of project deviations.
uu Earned value analysis. Described in Section 7.4.2.2. Earned value provides an integrated perspective on scope, 
schedule, and cost performance.
uu Root cause analysis. Described in Section 8.2.2.2. Root cause analysis focuses on identifying the main reasons 
of a problem. It can be used to identify the reasons for a deviation and the areas the project manager should focus 
on in order to achieve the objectives of the project.
uu Trend analysis. Trend analysis is used to forecast future performance based on past results. It looks ahead in the 
project for expected slippages and warns the project manager ahead of time that there may be problems later in 
the schedule if established trends persist. This information is made available early enough in the project timeline 
to give the project team time to analyze and correct any anomalies. The results of trend analysis can be used to 
recommend preventive actions if necessary.
uu Variance analysis. Variance analysis reviews the differences (or variance) between planned and actual 
performance. This can include duration estimates, cost estimates, resources utilization, resources rates, technical 
performance, and other metrics. 

Document analysis. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. Assessing available documentation will allow identifying 
lessons learned and knowledge sharing for future projects and organizational assets improvement.
uu Regression analysis. This technique analyzes the interrelationships between different project variables that 
contributed to the project outcomes to improve performance on future projects.
Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is used to determine the amount of contingency and management reserve 
needed for the project

What-if scenario analysis. What-if scenario analysis is the process of evaluating scenarios in order to predict 
their effect, positive or negative, on project objectives. This is an analysis of the question, “What if the situation 
represented by scenario X happens?” A

Simulation. Simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty 
to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. The most common simulation technique is 
Monte Carlo analysis (see Section 11.4.2.5), in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are used to calculate 
possible schedule outcomes for the total project

Earned value analysis. Described in Section 7.4.2.2. Schedule performance measurements such as schedule 
variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) are used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original 
schedule baseline.

Iteration burndown chart. This chart tracks the work that remains to be completed in the iteration backlog. It 
is used to analyze the variance with respect to an ideal burndown based on the work committed from iteration 
planning


Cost of quality. The cost of quality (COQ) associated with a project consists of one or more of the following costs 
(Figure 8-5 lists examples for each cost group):
un Prevention costs. Costs related to the prevention of poor quality in the products, deliverables, or services of 
the specific project.
un Appraisal costs. Costs related to evaluating, measuring, auditing, and testing the products, deliverables, or 
services of the specific project.
un Failure costs (internal/external). Costs related to nonconformance of the products, deliverables, or services to 
the needs or expectations of the stakeholders


Process analysis. Process analysis identifies opportunities for process improvements. This analysis also 
examines problems, constraints, and non-value-added activities that occur during a process.
uu Root cause analysis (RCA). Root cause analysis is an analytical technique used to determine the basic underlying 
reason that causes a variance, defect, or risk. A root cause may underlie more than one variance, defect, or risk. It 
may also be used as a technique for identifying root causes of a problem and solving them. When all root causes 
for a problem are removed, the problem does not recur


Performance reviews. Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze the quality metrics defined by the 
Plan Quality Management process against the actual results
