Leads and lags


A lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity. For example, 
on a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping could be scheduled to start 2 weeks prior to the scheduled 
punch list completion. This would be shown as a finish-to-start with a 2-week lead. Lead is often 
represented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software.

A lag is the amount of time a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity. For example, 
a technical writing team may begin editing the draft of a large document 15 days after they begin writing it. This can be 
shown as a start-to-start relationship with a 15-day lag
