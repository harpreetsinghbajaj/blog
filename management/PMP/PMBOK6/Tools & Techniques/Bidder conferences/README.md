Bidder conferences 

Bidder conferences (also called contractor conferences, vendor conferences, and pre-bid conferences) are meetings 
between the buyer and prospective sellers prior to proposal submittal. They are used to ensure that all prospective 
bidders have a clear and common understanding of the procurement and no bidders receive preferential treatment.
