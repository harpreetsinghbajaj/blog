Parametric estimating


Parametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration based 
on historical data and project parameters. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical data 
and other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate an estimate for activity parameters, such as cost, 
budget, and duration. This technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into 
the model
