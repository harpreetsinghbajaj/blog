Communication methods

A systematic procedure, technique, or process used to transfer information among project 
stakeholders.

There are several communication methods that are used to share information among project stakeholders. These 
methods are broadly classified as follows:
uu Interactive communication. Between two or more parties performing a multidirectional exchange of information 
in real time. It employs communications artifacts such as meetings, phone calls, instant messaging, some forms 
of social media, and videoconferencing.
uu Push communication. Sent or distributed directly to specific recipients who need to receive the information. 
This ensures that the information is distributed but does not ensure that it actually reached or was understood 
by the intended audience. Push communications artifacts include letters, memos, reports, emails, faxes, voice 
mails, blogs, and press releases.
uu Pull communication. Used for large complex information sets, or for large audiences, and requires the recipients 
to access content at their own discretion subject to security procedures. These methods include web portals, 
intranet sites, e-learning, lessons learned databases, or knowledge repositories



Different approaches should be applied to meet the needs of the major forms of communication defined in the 
communications management plan:
uu Interpersonal communication. Information is exchanged between individuals, typically face-to-face.
uu Small group communication. Occurs within groups of around three to six people.
uu Public communication. A single speaker addressing a group of people.
uu Mass communication. There is a minimal connection between the person or group sending the message and 
the large, sometimes anonymous groups for whom the information is intended.
uu Networks and social computing communication. Supports emerging communication trends of many-to-many 
supported by social computing technology and media.
