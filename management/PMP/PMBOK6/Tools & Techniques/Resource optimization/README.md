Resource optimization

used to adjust the start and finish dates of activities to adjust planned resource use to be 
equal to or less than resource availability

Examples of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust the 
schedule model due to demand and supply of resources include:

Resource leveling. A technique in which start and finish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints with 
the goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply. Resource leveling can be used when 
shared or critically required resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities, or are overallocated, such as when a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same time period.

Resource smoothing. A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements for 
resources on the project do not exceed certain predefined resource limits. In resource smoothing, as opposed to 
resource leveling, the projectâ€™s critical path is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed. I
