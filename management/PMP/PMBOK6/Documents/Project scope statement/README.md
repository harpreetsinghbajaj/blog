The project scope statement is the description of the project scope, major deliverables, assumptions, and constraints. 
The project scope statement documents the entire scope, including project and product scope. It describes the project’s 
deliverables in detail. It also provides a common understanding of the project scope among project stakeholders.



The detailed project scope statement, either directly or by reference to other documents, includes the following:
uu Product scope description. Progressively elaborates the characteristics of the product, service, or result 
described in the project charter and requirements documentation.
uu Deliverables. Any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is required 
to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables also include ancillary results, such as 
project management reports and documentation. These deliverables may be described at a summary level 
or in great detail.
uu Acceptance criteria. A set of conditions that is required to be met before deliverables are accepted.
uu Project exclusions. Identifies what is excluded from the project. Explicitly stating what is out of scope for the 
project helps manage stakeholders’ expectations and can reduce scope creep
