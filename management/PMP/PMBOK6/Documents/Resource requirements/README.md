The types and quantities of resources required for each activity in a work package
Resource requirements identify the types and quantities of resources required for each work package or activity in a 
work package and can be aggregated to determine the estimated resources for each work package, each WBS branch, 
and the project as a whole. The amount of detail and the level of specificity of the resource requirement descriptions 
can vary by application area. The resource requirementsâ€™ documentation can include assumptions that were made in 
determining which types of resources are applied, their availability, and what quantities are needed.
