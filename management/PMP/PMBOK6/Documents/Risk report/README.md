. A project document developed progressively throughout the Project Risk Management processes, which 
summarizes information on individual project risks and the level of overall project risk

The risk report presents information on sources of overall project risk, together with summary information on identified 
individual project risks. The risk report is developed progressively throughout the Project Risk Management process. The 
results of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, Implement Risk 
Responses, and Monitor Risks are also included in the risk report as those processes are completed. On completion of 
the Identify Risks process, information in the risk report may include but is not limited to:
uu Sources of overall project risk, indicating which are the most important drivers of overall project risk exposure; 
and
uu Summary information on identified individual project risks, such as number of identified threats and opportunities, 
distribution of risks across risk categories, metrics and trends, etc
