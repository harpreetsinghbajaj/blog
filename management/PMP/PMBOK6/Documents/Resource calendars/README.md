A resource calendar identifies the working days, shifts, start and end of normal business 
hours, weekends, and public holidays when each specific resource is available. Information on which resources 
(such as team resource, equipment, and material) are potentially available during a planned activity period is 
used for estimating resource utilization. Resource calendars also specify when, and for how long, identified 
team and physical resources will be available during the project.
