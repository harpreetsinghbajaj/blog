A repository in which outputs of risk management processes are recorded
The risk register captures details of identified individual project risks. The results of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, 
Plan Risk Responses, Implement Risk Responses, and Monitor Risks are recorded in the risk register as those processes 
are conducted throughout the project. The risk register may contain limited or extensive risk information depending on 
project variables such as size and complexity

On completion of the Identify Risks process, the content of the risk register may include but is not limited to:
uu List of identified risks. Each individual project risk is given a unique identifier in the risk register. Identified risks 
are described in as much detail as required to ensure unambiguous understanding. A structured risk statement 
may be used to distinguish risks from their cause(s) and their effect(s).
uu Potential risk owners. Where a potential risk owner has been identified during the Identify Risks process, the 
risk owner is recorded in the risk register. This will be confirmed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis 
process.
uu List of potential risk responses. Where a potential risk response has been identified during the Identify Risks 
process, it is recorded in the risk register. This will be confirmed during the Plan Risk Responses process
