Cost estimates include quantitative assessments of the probable costs required to complete project work, as well as 
contingency amounts to account for identified risks, and management reserve to cover unplanned work. 
Costs are estimated for all resources that are applied to the cost 
estimate. This includes but is not limited to direct labor, materials, equipment, services, facilities, information technology, 
and special categories such as cost of financing (including interest charges), an inflation allowance, exchange rates, 
or a cost contingency reserve. Indirect costs, if they are included in the project estimate, can be included at the activity 
level or at higher levels
