A description of how individual requirements meet the business need for the project
Requirements documentation describes how individual requirements meet the business need for the project. 
Requirements may start out at a high level and become progressively more detailed as more information about the 
requirements is known. Before being baselined, requirements need to be unambiguous (measurable and testable), 
traceable, complete, consistent, and acceptable to key stakeholders. The format of the requirements document may 
range from a simple document listing all the requirements categorized by stakeholder and priority, to more elaborate 
forms containing an executive summary, detailed descriptions, and attachments

Many organizations categorize requirements into different types, such as business and technical solutions, the 
former referring to stakeholder needs and the latter as to how those needs will be implemented. Requirements can 
be grouped into classifications allowing for further refinement and detail as the requirements are elaborated. These 
classifications include:
uu Business requirements. These describe the higher-level needs of the organization as a whole, such as the 
business issues or opportunities, and reasons why a project has been undertaken.
uu Stakeholder requirements. These describe needs of a stakeholder or stakeholder group.
uu Solution requirements. These describe features, functions, and characteristics of the product, service, or 
result that will meet the business and stakeholder requirements. Solution requirements are further grouped into 
functional and nonfunctional requirements:
un Functional requirements. Functional requirements describe the behaviors of the product. Examples include 
actions, processes, data, and interactions that the product should execute.
un Nonfunctional requirements. Nonfunctional requirements supplement functional requirements and describe 
the environmental conditions or qualities required for the product to be effective. Examples include: reliability, 
security, performance, safety, level of service, supportability, retention/purge, etc.
uu Transition and readiness requirements. These describe temporary capabilities, such as data conversion and 
training requirements, needed to transition from the current as-is state to the desired future state.

Project requirements. These describe the actions, processes, or other conditions the project needs to meet. 
Examples include milestone dates, contractual obligations, constraints, etc.
uu Quality requirements. These capture any condition or criteria needed to validate the successful completion 
of a project deliverable or fulfillment of other project requirements. Examples include tests, certifications, 
validations, etc.
