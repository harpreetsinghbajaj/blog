The collection of information for describing and controlling the schedul
The schedule data for the project schedule model is the collection of information for describing and controlling the 
schedule. The schedule data includes, at a minimum, the schedule milestones, schedule activities, activity attributes, 
and documentation of all identified assumptions and constraints. The amount of additional data varies by application 
area. Information frequently supplied as supporting detail includes but is not limited to:
uu Resource requirements by time period, often in the form of a resource histogram;
uu Alternative schedules, such as best-case or worst-case, not resource-leveled or resource-leveled, or with or 
without imposed dates; and
uu Applied schedule reserves
