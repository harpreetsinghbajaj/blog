Mme selection procedure is performed by enodeb using the tac id sent by the ue. The tac id is used to find the mme using served gummie list shared by mme in s1 setup response. Tac can be used to create a fqdn and query dns to get the mme identity.

Sgw selection happens in the same way as above 

Pgw selection is done in the same way but using the apn created fqdn
