Little endian means least significant byte is at the lowest address 
Big endian means least significant byte is at highest address 

Similarly it is for bits.

Int num = 0x0a0b0c0d;

Most significant digit is 0a and least significant digit is 0d 

num[0] represents the least significant address. Now if it has 0a then it is big endian else little endian.

Generally bit and byte endianess are same 

This is an important concept while working with binary protocols.
