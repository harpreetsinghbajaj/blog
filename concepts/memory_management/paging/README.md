Demand paging is the concept of lazy loading wherein the page is loaded into the memory when required.
Page fault is the condition when the address required by the process is not in the main memory and need to be fetched from secondary storage.

Thrashing is the situation when for a process a lot of page faults are occuring which increases the page swaps. This occurs when the process is allocated less number of page frames lesser than the number of pages.

To replace pages from the memory, following algorithms are used:à


FIFO. Beledey’s anamoly shows that page faults increases when the page frames increase.


Optimal replacement. This is not possible because it is based on the knowlwdge of future occurrence of pages.

LRU. This is the one that is based on the fact that the least recently used will be replaced from memory.



Protection fault means that the page that belongs to one process space cannot be written by any other process.

Paging is that only the required pages are moved to the main memory. So multiple processes are existing the main memory for execution.
