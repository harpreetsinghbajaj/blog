DMA is no CPU at all. The device has programming interface that you can use and then device will directly copy the data to the destination. DMA is a controller in itself which is a special hardware unit that interfaces the main memory with the peripheral devices. DMA controller shares the memory bus with CPU.


In DMA it is required that u have contiguous physical memory else an mmu will be required. MMU is memory management unit
