In the interrupt, we register for an interrupt that is a callback function to be invoked when the transfer of data is complete. This involves some amount of CPU power to instruct the device what and where to transfer and then CPU is involved in other work and our application is in waiting state/sleeping state. When the transfer is complete then the device will generate an interrupt that the CPU will handle and call our callback so that we can take charge of our data processing.
