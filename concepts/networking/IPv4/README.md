The class full addressing is a problem which means that a bigger ip address assigned to a company may not be fully usable thereby causing wastage of IP addresses. This wastage has been prevented by means of subnetting method called class less addressing CIDR (class less inter domain routing). Same thing has been used in the ipv6.  The creation of subsets etc is a cumbersome task but this is not the problem with ipv6. This is that no NAT is required in the ipv6

More nat layers introduce delay in the packet processing.

The next thing is variable ipv4 header which makes the router difficult when this routing logic is embedded in the hardware. This ipv6 has a fix header length.

The local addresse can be auto configured by the ipv6 nodes but this is not possible in the ipv4. 

IPv4 has a variable header with the options field. Thus hardware processing is not possible for o this.
